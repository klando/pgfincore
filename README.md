# PgFincore

--------------------------------------------------------------
 A set of functions to manage pages in memory from PostgreSQL
--------------------------------------------------------------

A set of functions to handle low-level management of relations using mincore to
explore cache memory.

## DESCRIPTION

With PostgreSQL, each Table or Index is splitted in segments of (usually) 1GB,
and each segment is splitted in pages in memory then in blocks for the
filesystem.

Those functions let you know which and how many disk block from a relation are
in the page cache of the operating system. It can provide the result as a VarBit
and can be stored in a table. Then using this table, it is possible to restore
the page cache state for each block of the relation, even in another server,
thanks to Streaming Replication.

Other functions are used to set a *POSIX_FADVISE* flag on the entire relation
(each segment). The more usefull are probably *WILLNEED* and *DONTNEED* which
push and pop blocks of each segments of a relation from page cache,
respectively.

Each functions are call with at least a table name or an index name (or oid)
as a parameter and walk each segment of the relation.

## DOWNLOAD

You can grab the latest code with git:

    git clone git://git.postgresql.org/git/pgfincore.git
    or
    git://github.com/pgfincore/pgfincore.git
    or
    git://github.com/klando/pgfincore.git

## INSTALL

From source code:

    make clean
    make
    su
    make install

Log in your database and:

    mydb=# CREATE EXTENSION pgfincore;

PgFincore is also shipped with Debian scripts to build your own package:

    aptitude install debhelper postgresql-server-dev-all postgresql-server-dev-9.1
    #Â or postgresql-server-dev-8.4|postgresql-server-dev-9.0
    make deb

PgFincore is packaged for *RPM* at http://yum.postgresql.org/
PgFincore is packaged for *debian* at http://pgapt.debian.net/
PgFincore extension is available with several major SQL cloud providers.

## EXAMPLES

Here are some examples of usage. If you want more details go to Documentation_

### Get current state of a relation

May be useful:

    cedric=# select * from pgfincore('pgbench_accounts');
          relpath       | segment | os_page_size | rel_os_pages | pages_mem | group_mem | os_pages_free | databit | pages_dirty | group_dirty 
    --------------------+---------+--------------+--------------+-----------+-----------+---------------+---------+-------------+-------------
     base/11874/16447   |       0 |         4096 |       262144 |    262144 |         1 |         81016 |         |           0 |           0
     base/11874/16447.1 |       1 |         4096 |        65726 |     65726 |         1 |         81016 |         |           0 |           0
    (2 rows)
    
    Time: 31.563 ms

### Load a table or an index in OS Page Buffer

You may want to try to keep a table or an index into the OS Page Cache, or
preload a table before your well know big query is executed (reducing the query
time).

To do so, just execute the following query:

    cedric=# select * from pgfadvise_willneed('pgbench_accounts');
          relpath       | os_page_size | rel_os_pages | os_pages_free 
    --------------------+--------------+--------------+---------------
     base/11874/16447   |         4096 |       262144 |        169138
     base/11874/16447.1 |         4096 |        65726 |        103352
    (2 rows)
     
    Time: 4462,936 ms

  * The column *os_page_size* report that page size is 4KB.
  * The column *rel_os_pages* is the number of pages of the specified file.
  * The column *os_pages_free* is the number of free pages in memory (for caching).

### Snapshot and Restore the OS Page Buffer state of a table or an index (or more)

You may want to restore a table or an index into the OS Page Cache as it was
while you did the snapshot. For example if you have to reboot your server, then
when PostgreSQL start up the first queries might be slower because neither
PostgreSQL or the OS have pages in their respective cache about the relations
involved in those first queries.

Executing a snapshot and a restore is very simple:

    -- Snapshot
    cedric=# create table pgfincore_snapshot as
    cedric-#   select 'pgbench_accounts'::text as relname,*,now() as date_snapshot
    cedric-#   from pgfincore('pgbench_accounts',true);
    
    -- Restore
    cedric=# select * from pgfadvise_loader('pgbench_accounts', 0, true, true,
                           (select databit from  pgfincore_snapshot
                            where relname='pgbench_accounts' and segment = 0));
         relpath      | os_page_size | os_pages_free | pages_loaded | pages_unloaded 
    ------------------+--------------+---------------+--------------+----------------
     base/11874/16447 |         4096 |         80867 |       262144 |              0
    (1 row)
    
    Time: 35.349 ms

 * The column *pages_loaded* report how many pages have been read to memory
   (they may have already been in memoy)
 * The column *pages_unloaded* report how many pages have been removed from
   memory (they may not have already been in memoy);

## DOCUMENTATION

### pgsysconf

This function output size of OS blocks, number of free page in the OS Page Buffer.

    cedric=# select * from pgsysconf();
     os_page_size | os_pages_free | os_total_pages 
    --------------+---------------+----------------
             4096 |         80431 |        4094174

### pgsysconf_pretty

The same as above, but with pretty output.

    cedric=# select * from pgsysconf_pretty();
     os_page_size | os_pages_free | os_total_pages 
    --------------+---------------+----------------
    4096 bytes   | 314 MB        | 16 GB

### pgfadvise_WILLNEED

This function set *WILLNEED* flag on the current relation. It means that the
Operating Sytem will try to load as much pages as possible of the relation.
Main idea is to preload files on server startup, perhaps using cache hit/miss
ratio or most required relations/indexes.

    cedric=# select * from pgfadvise_willneed('pgbench_accounts');
          relpath       | os_page_size | rel_os_pages | os_pages_free 
    --------------------+--------------+--------------+---------------
     base/11874/16447   |         4096 |       262144 |         80650
     base/11874/16447.1 |         4096 |        65726 |         80650

### pgfadvise_DONTNEED

This function set *DONTNEED* flag on the current relation. It means that the
Operating System will first unload pages of the file if it need to free some
memory. Main idea is to unload files when they are not usefull anymore (instead
of perhaps more interesting pages)

    cedric=# select * from pgfadvise_dontneed('pgbench_accounts');
          relpath       | os_page_size | rel_os_pages | os_pages_free
    --------------------+--------------+--------------+---------------
     base/11874/16447   |         4096 |       262144 |        342071
     base/11874/16447.1 |         4096 |        65726 |        408103


### pgfadvise_NORMAL

This function set *NORMAL* flag on the current relation.

### pgfadvise_SEQUENTIAL

This function set *SEQUENTIAL* flag on the current relation.

### pgfadvise_RANDOM

This function set *RANDOM* flag on the current relation.

### pgfadvise_loader

This function allow to interact directly with the Page Cache.
It can be used to load and/or unload page from memory based on a varbit
representing the map of the pages to load/unload accordingly.

Work with relation pgbench_accounts, segment 0, arbitrary varbit map:

    -- Loading and Unloading
    cedric=# select * from pgfadvise_loader('pgbench_accounts', 0, true, true, B'111000');
         relpath      | os_page_size | os_pages_free | pages_loaded | pages_unloaded 
    ------------------+--------------+---------------+--------------+----------------
     base/11874/16447 |         4096 |        408376 |            3 |              3
 
    -- Loading
    cedric=# select * from pgfadvise_loader('pgbench_accounts', 0, true, false, B'111000');
         relpath      | os_page_size | os_pages_free | pages_loaded | pages_unloaded 
    ------------------+--------------+---------------+--------------+----------------
     base/11874/16447 |         4096 |        408370 |            3 |              0
 
    -- Unloading
    cedric=# select * from pgfadvise_loader('pgbench_accounts', 0, false, true, B'111000');
        relpath      | os_page_size | os_pages_free | pages_loaded | pages_unloaded 
    ------------------+--------------+---------------+--------------+----------------
     base/11874/16447 |         4096 |        408370 |            0 |              3

### pgfincore

This function provide information about the file system cache (page cache). 

    cedric=# select * from pgfincore('pgbench_accounts');
          relpath       | segment | os_page_size | rel_os_pages | pages_mem | group_mem | os_pages_free | databit | pages_dirty | group_dirty  
    --------------------+---------+--------------+--------------+-----------+-----------+---------------+---------+-------------+-------------
     base/11874/16447   |       0 |         4096 |       262144 |         3 |         1 |        408444 |         |           0 |           0
     base/11874/16447.1 |       1 |         4096 |        65726 |         0 |         0 |        408444 |         |           0 |           0

For the specified relation it returns:

  * relpath : the relation path 
  * segment : the segment number analyzed 
  * os_page_size : the size of one page
  * rel_os_pages : the total number of pages of the relation
  * pages_mem : the total number of relation's pages in page cache.
    (not the shared buffers from PostgreSQL but the OS cache)
  * group_mem : the number of groups of adjacent pages_mem
  * os_page_free : the number of free page in the OS page cache
  * databit : the varbit map of the file, because of its size it is useless to output
    Use pgfincore('pgbench_accounts',true) to activate it.
  * pages_dirty : if HAVE_FINCORE constant is define and the platorm provides the relevant information, like pages_mem but for dirtied pages 
  * group_dirty : if HAVE_FINCORE constant is define and the platorm provides the relevant information, like group_mem but for dirtied pages 

### pg_page_size

--------------
         8192
(1 row)
```

### pg_segment_size

Get max PostgreSQL segment size in blocks:

```{.sqlpostgresql}
SELECT vm_available_pages();
 vm_available_pages 
--------------------
              94986

## DEBUG

You can debug the PgFincore with the following error level: *DEBUG1* and
*DEBUG5*.

For example:

    set client_min_messages TO debug1; -- debug5 is only usefull to trace each block

## REQUIREMENTS

 * PgFincore needs sysconf(), mincore() or fincore() and POSIX_FADVISE
 * PgFincore requires PostgreSQL > 9.3

## LIMITATIONS

 * PgFincore has a limited mode when POSIX_FADVISE is not provided by the platform.
 * PgFincore does not work on windows.
